# Lost Ark Fishing Bot

This is a simple fishing bot for Lost Ark. It uses OpenCV to detect the exclamation point [!] in the screen.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6+
- PIP

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Set up virtual environment (Recommended)
3. Install requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
1. Activate virtual environment (if you set one up)
2. Run the bot with `python main.py` (in the project directory)
3. You have 5 seconds to switch to the game window and point the cursor at the fishing spot. The Trade Skill mode must be active (B).

## Notes
- For the time being, the bot will only work in the main monitor.
- The bot will run endlessly, so you will have to stop it manually by pressing Ctrl+C in the terminal.

## Planned features
- [ ] Support for multiple monitors
- [ ] Automatic resolution detection
- [ ] Pet function tool repair (repairs the fishing rod after a certain number of casts)
